## What was the work done

In chapter 2<a name='chapter2'></a> the very first programms of [insertionSort](https://github.com/aapodolskiy/algorithms/tree/master/Sort/insertionSort "link to the files in repo") 
were created

Todo no 1 now is to adapt all code for using file input and to create some huge input file for 
future testing
